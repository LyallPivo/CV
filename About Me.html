    <h3><u><em>About Me</em></u></h3>
    <p>
      The problem with our society is that everything is given a label and a set specification. A plant,animal, or even an insect can be given a set label and told to be on its way but that is not what a human being
      is. A human being can be many different things in his lifetime. A human being is literally limitless in the possibility open to him. I don't identify with anything. THe things I do, the things I own. The things I think or feel. The body I
      posses
      and the mind I use are not my identifying factors. This is a major problem our society has fallen into. We are not identified by the body,the mind or the material we have molded into our possesions. My identify as a human being is routed in the
      never changing, the forever non-physical, the ever peaceful. The problem with the society people have created for themselves is that people have forgotten who they are. They have confused their mental formations for themselves; their
      ideas,thoughts,feelings have now become who they are. This is the personality of you but this is not who YOU are. You are not the body, the mind or the things you have accumulated through the years.I know who I am, do you know who you are?
